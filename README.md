# CS2420-BucketSorting
This project for my CS 2420, Data Structures and Algorithms class, had us design a Bucket sorting algorithm in both a single and multi-threaded implementation to show the power of multi-threading. The assignment was written by my professor Bradley Peterson with Weber State University, in which he made the framework and I wrote the rest.
